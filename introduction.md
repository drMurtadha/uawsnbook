### Introduction to Sensor Networks

A sensor network consists of interconnected devices, known as sensors, that monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, or motion, and transmit the collected data to a central system for processing. These networks play a vital role in various fields, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, agriculture, and smart cities. Sensors can be placed in remote or difficult-to-access areas to collect data in real-time, making them invaluable for tracking conditions like pollution levels, soil moisture, or energy usage. The network's ability to communicate wirelessly allows it to cover large geographical areas, often organized in a decentralized manner where individual sensors operate independently while coordinating with neighboring sensors. This enables the network to be resilient, as it can continue functioning even if some sensors fail. The data collected is sent to a central processing unit (or cloud server), where it is analyzed and used for decision-making, automation, or further studies. Advances in low-power sensors and wireless communication technologies, such as Zigbee or LoRaWAN, have significantly expanded the applications of sensor networks, reducing the need for human intervention and enabling real-time insights. In healthcare, for example, wearable sensors can monitor vital signs and detect potential health issues before they become critical, while in agriculture, sensor networks help optimize irrigation systems by assessing soil conditions and weather patterns. As sensor networks continue to evolve, they are becoming smarter and more efficient, playing an integral role in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, where everyday objects are connected and communicate with each other to improve various processes and services.

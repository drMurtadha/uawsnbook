**Preface**

The rapid advancements in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have opened new frontiers in various fields, including underwater applications. This book, "Routing Protocols for Underwater Networks," aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the unique challenges and innovative solutions in the realm of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWASNs). The primary purpose of this book is to explore the intricacies of routing protocols specifically designed for underwater environments, addressing the high propagation delay, path loss, and energy consumption that distinguish these networks from their terrestrial counterparts.

**Purpose of the Book**

The motivation behind this book stems from the growing interest in utilizing WSNs for underwater applications such as oceanography, environmental monitoring, undersea exploration, and disaster prevention. Traditional routing protocols used in terrestrial WSNs are not suitable for underwater environments due to the dynamic nature of underwater nodes and the inapplicability of GPS. This book delves into the development and classification of greedy routing protocols, offering insights into both location-based and location-free approaches. By presenting a detailed survey of existing protocols and their comparative analysis, this book aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.

**Target Audience**

This book is intended for a diverse audience, including researchers, engineers, and students specializing in computer science, electrical engineering, and marine technology. It is also beneficial for professionals working in industries related to underwater exploration, environmental monitoring, and military applications. The content is structured to cater to both beginners seeking foundational knowledge and experts looking for advanced insights into the latest developments in UWASNs.

**Importance and Strength of the Book**

One of the key strengths of this book is its focus on greedy routing protocols, which are considered the most promising for underwater environments due to their simplicity and efficiency[^1^][1]. The book provides a thorough classification of these protocols, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Additionally, it offers practical recommendations for future research, making it a valuable guide for ongoing and future studies. The inclusion of detailed comparisons and simulation results further enhances the book's utility as a reference for designing and implementing effective routing strategies in UWASNs.

**Resources**

The content of this book is derived from extensive literature reviews, research papers, and case studies from reputable sources. The references and resources used are meticulously selected to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information presented. Readers can access additional resources and supplementary materials through the book's dedicated website, which provides links to related research articles, simulation tools, and datasets.

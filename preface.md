**Preface**

The vast and largely unexplored underwater world presents unique challenges and opportunities for researchers and engineers. With the advent of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), there has been a growing interest in applying this technology to underwater environments. However, the underwater medium, characterized by high propagation delay, high path loss, low bandwidth, and high-energy consumption, necessitates the development of specialized routing protocols.

This book delves into the intricacies of **greedy routing protocols** for underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWASNs). It categorizes these protocols into **location-based** and **location-free** methods, further subdividing the latter into **beacon-based** and **pressure-based** protocols. By examining the advantages and disadvantages of various protocols, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of greedy routing in UWASNs.

We hope this book serves as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals in the field, inspiring further advancements in underwater communication technologies.
